  "description" : "\nWelcome to Ztarbound; A mod that aims to improve some of the untouched by mods vanilla aspects and add some more tools for modders to play with!\nZtarbound does not add any content of its own (Other than a few things), as its aim is to add features instead of content.\nSome of those feature are...\n\n - Update Info Window -\nUnless constantly keeping track of installed mods, players have no proper way of telling whether something updated. Especially if they have a lot of mods installed.\nThis window aims to fix that by popping up whenever a mod is updated, displaying some information about the mod, as well as a changelog.\n\n - Research System -\nA system that gives the option to organize progression in a more strict fashion, and preventing the player from getting lost in a sea of content.\nUsing this, you can lock blueprints behind research with varying prices, trigger certain events, or even make a skill tree!\n\n - Questlist -\nAn organized place to view lists of quests and their requirements.\nUseful for tutorials, storylines, or just making a \"to-do\" list.\n\n - Scan Interactions -\nEver wanted to hide a button from the infamous \"alt\" key?\nOr maybe make your own scan quests?\nMaybe an object that displays dynamic data?\nWell this addition adds the option to set up a \"what happens when this object is scanned\" function!\n\n - New SAIL -\nNot only did SAIL get a new look, but it now comes with a handful of extra options!\nView currencies added by other mods that cannot be viewed on the inventory pane.\nMissions are split to main and secondary, as well as displaying which missions are replays.\nAnd the option to add your own functions to SAIL.\nFully compatible with Scripted SAIL.\nNOTE: If you want a custom SAIL, install the scripted SAIL mod and the chip for the custom AI version you want.\nNOTE: If you're using a custom race, you must install this patch for the new SAIL to appear:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1411331676\n\n - FU's Music Player -\nNow in standalone version, and with an easier method of adding music!\nCan even make your own addon for personal use with ease!\nCraftable at the anvil, under the EPP section.\n\n - Utility + Example Scripts -\nThere are some scripts which can help with making a text be typed out instead of appearing instantly, fading hex colors, rolling dice, and more!\nAnd some example for setting up your own things, such a function upon leaving/entering a world.\n\n - And more to come! -\n\nDocumentation for using these feature can be found inside the \"_doc\" folder on the Github repo of this mod:\nhttps://github.com/zimberzimber/Ztarbound\n\nBe advised: Ztarbound is already built into Frackin' Universe, so there's no point in having them both installed.\n\nQuestions? Complaints? Suggestions? Random chit-chat?\nYou can reach me through the Frackin' Universe Discord server.\n",
